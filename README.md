Objective: To create a neater database/library for applications

(Work in Progress- there is alot parts to consider, trying to gather the impt parts in an application - brb)

Using C++ and Sql for database

Issues :
Using excel tracker as a base, but the tracker is prone to errors due to the whole dept having access
they might decide to password encrypted excel but it looks quite messy still

Errors have been made - accidental deletion, addition, replacement of names etc
3 tabs - active cases (officer is assigned), queue (applications not assigned yet), archive (application has been done - either withdrawn/approved)

3 types of applications to consider: B,S and L

For active cases - would need to check if docs are in, date, paid,
For queue - 
For archive - 


Code will:
create a table -
